READ THIS FILE if you are updating from previous versions of 
  'taxonomy_access.module'.

If you are installing taxonomy_access.module for the first time, you may ignore
  this file.

Taxonomy Access uses the AUTOMATED UPDATE SYSTEM of Drupal (since Drupal 4.7)

--------
UPDATING
--------

1. DISABLE THE MODULE on page: "Administer >> Site building >> Modules"

2. BACKUP your database

3. UPLOAD the new module files

4. LOG ON AS MAIN ADMINISTRATOR (user with user ID 1)

5. ENABLE THE MODULE on page: "Administer >> Site building >> Modules"

6. RUN UPDATE.PHP by visiting "http://www.example.com/update.php"

7. SET OPTIONS FOR TAXONOMY ACCESS SETTINGS: Go to page: "Administer >> Site configuration >> 
      Taxonomy Access: Settings"

8. SET PERMISSION 'Administer Access Controll' FOR ADMINISTRATORS on page: 
     "Administer >> User Management >> Access Control".
    (In versions before 5.x permission was 'Administer users')

-----------------------
UPDATING FROM VERSION 5.1 OR PREVIOUS
-----------------------

If one upgrades an existing site using an older version (5.1 or before) of TAC, then no 
performance gains will be made until the admin goes through each role and "rebuilds" 
the permissions settings for each role from scratch (i.e. disable TAC for that role, 
then set it up again with just the categories and terms to apply TAC settings to).


-----------------------
TAXONOMY ACCESS UPDATES
-----------------------

Update #1: Updating the tables to UTF-8
Update #2: Adding new field 'grant_list' to the tables.
           (Neccessary after revision 1.53 Jan 12, 2006)
Update #3: Changing weight of the  module: put taxonomy_access to the bottom 
           (but before the very last ones) in the chain.
Update #4: Deleting old variable 'taxonomy_access_enabled'
