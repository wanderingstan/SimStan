SimStan

A project by Stan James.

MySQL database is in file simstan.sql

Directory 'html' contains all files that should be put on your webserver. It is a basic Drupal 6 installation with several custom modules.

Search all files for the following values, which you need to replace with your own:

SIMSTAN_DB_USERNAME 
SIMSTAN_DB_PASSWORD
SIMSTAN_DB_NAME
YOUR_KEY_HERE
your@email.address.com

You will need to reset the password of user 1 (admin).

This is a quick-n-dirty release. Any questions, contact me at stan@wanderingstan.com
